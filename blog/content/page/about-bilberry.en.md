Welcome to the Cohen data team's blog!

Our mission is straightforward: **to make data accessible across the entire company**. We achieve this through a variety of approaches, ranging from developing interactive web sites in Shiny to creating APIs for our external providers to efficiently consume information. Additionally, we take pride in managing our data infrastructure, running our applications on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.

This blog was born out of a dual need. On one hand, **we want to create a resource for our future selves**, a repository of knowledge and experiences to refer back to when we need to remember how we tackled certain technical challenges. On the other hand, **we aim to contribute to the broader community** by sharing solutions and tips with those who might face similar issues to ours. Thus, we hope not only to make our daily work easier but also to assist others in their journey through the world of programming and data management.

We hope you find value in our articles and invite you to join us on this journey of learning and collaboration!
